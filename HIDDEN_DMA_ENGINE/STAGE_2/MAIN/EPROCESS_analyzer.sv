/*
 * Module for locating key memory references by traversing virtual structures:
 * 
 * - Waits for a known memory descriptor to become available.
 * - Reads a control structure pointer from a specific field offset.
 * - Follows a chain of memory references via virtual addresses through multiple levels.
 * - Compares Unicode strings from memory to identify a specific target.
 * - Once matched, computes a final virtual pointer by adding a predefined offset.
 * - Indicates completion after resolving both the control structure and the computed address.
 * - All memory reads are issued through a helper responsible for virtual-to-physical translation and PCIe compliance.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
