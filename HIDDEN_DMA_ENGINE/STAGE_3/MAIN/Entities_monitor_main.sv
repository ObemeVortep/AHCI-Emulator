/*
 * Orchestration unit for data monitoring using PCIe:
 *
 * - Waits for readiness signals from prerequisite modules before initiating operation.
 * - Resolves key pointers in memory using virtual address translation via a helper submodule.
 * - Controls a multi-phase monitoring process: initialization, discovery, dereferencing, and polling.
 * - Extracts specific data from memory and outputs a fixed-width register.
 * - Manages memory read lengths and translation requests using a helper submodule interface.
 * - Separates RX and TX paths and ensures arbitration against other PCIe traffic sources.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
