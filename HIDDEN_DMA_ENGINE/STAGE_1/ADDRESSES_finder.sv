/*
 * Scanning module for detecting memory regions matching predefined patterns:
 * 
 * - Coordinates two submodules: one issues memory read requests, the other analyzes completion data.
 * - Uses a fixed-length scanning strategy, incrementing through address space in aligned steps.
 * - Control logic determines scan initiation and termination based on target discovery.
 * - Upon match, halts scanning and exposes result via output register and completion flag.
 * - Modular structure separates address generation and pattern evaluation for clarity and reuse.
 * - Includes debug interfaces for internal state visibility if enabled via compile-time flags.
 * 
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
