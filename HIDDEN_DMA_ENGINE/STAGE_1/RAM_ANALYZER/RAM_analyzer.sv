/*
 * Memory pattern analysis module:
 * 
 * - Designed to identify specific sequences in memory by analyzing inbound completion packets.
 * - Operates in conjunction with a scanning module which initiates memory reads.
 * - Maintains a sliding window of bytes and checks for matches against a predefined masked signature.
 * - Uses a state machine to parse incoming packets and control the scanning flow.
 * - Supports flexible payload widths (1DW or 2DW) and accounts for PCIe-specific byte ordering.
 * - Upon successful match, reports the physical address and signals completion.
 * - Optional debug interface exposes internal state and signature matches for diagnostics.
 * 
 * All references to proprietary or application-specific identifiers have been omitted.
