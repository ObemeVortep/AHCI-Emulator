/*
 * Conditional debug output module for transmitting diagnostic data over a USB-based interface:
 * 
 * - Aggregates and streams internal state from various subsystems based on compile-time flags.
 * - Implements buffered debug data collection using FIFOs and synchronized multi-word transfers.
 * - Each active flag enables a dedicated data path for capturing and reporting protocol activity, memory analysis, or state monitoring.
 * - Uses state machines and flow control logic to serialize and transmit structured records without interfering with core functionality.
 * 
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
