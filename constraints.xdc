/*
 * Constraints and pin assignments file for defining physical I/O and timing behavior:
 * 
 * - Maps system, FT601, and PCIe signals to package pins and applies correct I/O standards.
 * - Creates clocks for both system and FT601 domains with specified periods.
 * - Configures slew rate and voltage levels to meet timing and electrical compatibility.
 * - Provides optional commented timing constraints for FT601 input/output paths.
 * - Specifies GT channel location and differential pairs for PCIe high-speed interfaces.
 * 
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
