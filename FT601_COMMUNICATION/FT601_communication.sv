/*
 * FT601 interface module for bidirectional data exchange and trigger signaling:
 * 
 * - Implements input command parsing to raise control signals for internal subsystem activation.
 * - Manages 32-bit bidirectional bus via IOBUFs with direction controlled by read-enable signal.
 * - Receives control words to initiate scanning phases, using a simple state machine for synchronization.
 * - Transmits structured data using an asynchronous FIFO with dual-clock operation.
 * - Sends serialized 320-bit payload in 32-bit segments through the output interface under flow control.
 * - Ensures reliable cross-domain communication and backpressure handling through handshake logic.
 * 
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
