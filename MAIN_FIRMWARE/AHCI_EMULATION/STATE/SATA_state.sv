/*
 * This module implements the core internal logic for managing the SATA controller and device state.
 * 
 * Inside, it instantiates two key submodules:
 *  - A finite state machine (SATA_fsm) that controls the behavior of the controller and disk,
 *    manages command execution, state transitions, and triggers interrupts.
 *  - A register handler module (SATA_regs) responsible for updating controller and device registers,
 *    processing register write requests from a FIFO interface, and synchronizing register states.
 * 
 * It handles incoming commands, coordinates asynchronous acknowledgments, and exposes the current
 * controller and disk states for other modules to monitor.
 * 
 * The module also manages MSI interrupt signaling and arbitration.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
