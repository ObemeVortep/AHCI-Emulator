/*
 * Emulates the communication logic of a SATA controller over PCIe:
 * 
 * - Defines the `SATA_communication` module, which mediates all register read/write
 *   transactions between host and simulated SATA controller.
 * 
 * - Incorporates two main submodules:
 *     • `SATA_rx`: handles RX path logic, including parsing MRd/MWr TLPs and buffering updates.
 *     • `SATA_tx`: handles TX path logic, generating CplD packets and FIS responses.
 * 
 * - Provides register interface FIFOs:
 *     • `fifo_regs_mrd`: queues host MRd requests for registers (readback)
 *     • `fifo_regs_to_update`: queues register writes from host MWr TLPs (to be committed)
 * 
 * - Includes debug signals to trace:
 *     • TLP tags, addresses, FIS contents, register data and write counts.
 * 
 * - Supports acknowledgment signaling (`fsm_ack`) and transfers parsed command content
 *   (`command_to_issue`) for coordination with control logic.
 * 
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
