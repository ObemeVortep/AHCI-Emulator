/*
 * Default transmit logic for handling register read responses:
 *
 * - Monitors a FIFO for pending memory read completions (CplD).
 * - Constructs 2-DW PCIe TLP packets with payloads from internal registers.
 * - Manages TX arbitration and ensures conflict-free access against FSM and DMA logic.
 * - Only activates if the state-driven TX logic is idle.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
