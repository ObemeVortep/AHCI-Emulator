/*
 * Manages outbound PCIe traffic for a simulated SATA controller:
 *
 * - Coordinates two independent transmission paths:
 *     • A default engine for replying to register read requests (CplD responses).
 *     • A state-driven engine for command emulation and SATA responses.
 * - Prioritizes TX arbitration between default, state-based, and DMA modules.
 * - Selectively sources data from internal FIFO queues or HBA state handlers.
 * - Integrates tightly with tag-based signaling from the receive logic.
 * - Synchronizes state acknowledgments and command forwarding for further stages.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
