/*
 * State-controlled transmit engine for SATA command emulation:
 *
 * - Generates outbound PCIe traffic (mainly FIS structures) based on current HBA state.
 * - Sends appropriate responses to SATA commands, including Register D2H and PIO Setup FIS.
 * - Interacts with key port registers and interprets tag-based input data.
 * - Handles command forwarding and completion signaling (ACK) to synchronize with FSM logic.
 * - Activated when HBA is in predefined operational states, independent of default TX logic.
 *
 * Code has been redacted for ethical and security reasons.
